# MWC - My Weight Control (with Java, Spring, Hibernate, AOP, and others)



You understand and agree that this system:

    - is only a PROTOTYPE using programming techniques, technology and resources such as JavaEE, Spring, Hibernate, etc.
    - is subject to errors, because it is still under development.
    - was created in 2014 FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY and DOESN'T use the best development architecture.
    - will be used as an example of migration from Monolith to Java Microservices in a future training.
    - will not send unsolicited e-mails to users. E-mails are sent only in response to an explicit request by the user.

You understand and agree that this system:

    - is NOT a web design demo. It was developed specifically to be executed on (? by? through? in?) Firefox 24, and there is no guarantee that the layout will be maintained in another browser.
    - should not be used in a production environment UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
     is incomplete in terms of functionalities, and logical or functional inconsistencies may appear.
    - is a STATISTICAL system, not a MEDICAL one, therefore it is NOT VALID FROM THE MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW. All mathematical calculations are based on data provided directly by the user.

You understand and agree that the data provided to the system:

    - will not be used for any activity outside of the system.
    - are not encrypted. That includes your password, so you must not use the same password in any other system.
    - ARE THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER. The proprietors of the system are exempt from any responsibility for the data and, consequently, for the results of the calculations made based on the data.

You understand and agree that the system administrator:

    - will use your e-mail address exclusively for personalized communication with you, and not for automated messages. In other words, you will not receive spam, messages will be written by the administrator him- or herself.
    - may monitor your activities on the system (through logging resources).
    - may close or deactivate an account, when administratively deemed necessary.
    - is not responsible for inappropriate or illegal use of the system by any user. If such activities are identified, the account will be closed immediately, and the user may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
